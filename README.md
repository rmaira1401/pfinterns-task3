Customer Lifetime Value Analysis
In this project, youâ€™ll perform a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis using real-world
transaction data to help businesses evaluate the long-term value of their customers. By
importing, cleaning, and modeling data using Power Query, you will calculate key metrics
such as total customer spend, average order value, purchase frequency, and CLV using
DAX. The project also includes designing interactive dashboards to visualize CLV
distribution and trends over time. This project will sharpen your data analysis and
visualization skills while providing actionable insights for enhancing customer retention
strategies.
